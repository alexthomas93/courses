== Understanding VectorCypherRetriever

The `VectorCypherRetriever` combines vector similarity with Cypher queries to retrieve relevant nodes from your Neo4j recommendations database. This integration allows for more refined searches by applying graph-specific filters alongside semantic similarity.


=== How It Works
image:images/vector-cypher-retrieval.png[VectorCypherRetriever,width=800,align=center]

* **Cypher Filtering**: Applies a Cypher query to filter nodes based on specific criteria.

== When to Use VectorCypherRetriever

* **Combined Filtering and Similarity**: When you need to filter nodes based on properties or relationships before performing a similarity search.
* **Structured and Unstructured Data**: Your graph contains both structured properties and unstructured text data.
* **Advanced Querying**: Require complex retrieval logic that leverages Cypher’s capabilities alongside vector similarity.

== Setting Up VectorCypherRetriever

Follow these steps to set up and use the `VectorCypherRetriever`.

=== Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Install the necessary Python packages:

[source, bash]
----
pip install neo4j-graphrag neo4j openai
----

=== Step 2: Connect to Your Neo4j Database

Establish a connection using the Neo4j Python driver:

[source, python]

----
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
uri = "neo4j+s://demo.neo4jlabs.com"
username = "recommendations"
password = "recommendations"
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(username, password))
----

=== Step 3: Set Up the Embedding Function

Define a function to generate query embeddings using OpenAI's model:

[source, python]
----
import os
from neo4j_graphrag.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-…"
embedder = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-ada-002")
----

=== Step 4: Initialize the VectorCypherRetriever

Create an instance of `VectorCypherRetriever` with a Cypher query:

[source, python]
----
from neo4j_graphrag.retrievers import VectorCypherRetriever

retrieval_query = """
MATCH
(actor:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(node)
RETURN
node.title AS movie_title,
node.plot AS movie_plot,
collect(actor.name) AS actors;
"""

retriever = VectorCypherRetriever(
    driver,
    index_name="moviePlotsEmbedding",
    embedder=embedder,
    retrieval_query=retrieval_query,
)
----
* `driver`: Neo4j database driver.
* `embedding_function`: Function to generate query embeddings.
* `vector_property`: Property storing node embeddings.
* `top_k`: Number of top similar nodes to retrieve.
* `cypher_query`: Cypher statement to filter nodes before similarity search.

== Example in Action

Assume you have a recommendations database with movies, each having an `embedding` property and a `genre` attribute.

=== Running the Retriever

Given a query, `VectorCypherRetriever` finds semantically similar thriller movies with strong female leads:

[source, python]
----
from neo4j_graphrag.generation import GraphRAG
from neo4j_graphrag.llm import OpenAILLM

llm = OpenAILLM(model_name="gpt-4o", model_params={"temperature": 0})
rag = GraphRAG(retriever=retriever, llm=llm)
query_text = "Who were the actors in the movie about the magic jungle board game?"
response = rag.search(query_text=query_text, retriever_config={"top_k": 5})
print(response.answer)
----
=== Expected Output

----
The actors in the movie "Jumanji," which is about a magical board game, are Robin Williams, Bradley Pierce, Kirsten Dunst, and Jonathan Hyde.
----

== Tips for Effective Use

* **Consistent Embeddings**: Use the same model for query and node embeddings.
* **Vector Indexing**: Create a vector index in Neo4j on the `embedding` property to speed up searches.
* **Optimize Cypher Queries**: Ensure your Cypher queries are efficient to reduce retrieval time.
