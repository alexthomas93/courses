== Understanding VectorRetriever

The VectorRetriever retrieves relevant nodes from your Neo4j recommendations database based on vector similarity using a vector index built over vector embeddings.

=== How It Works

*Query Embedding*: Converts the user's query into a vector using an embedding model.

*Similarity Search*: Finds nodes with embeddings similar to the query vector.
Retrieval: Returns the top relevant nodes to augment the language model's response.

== When to Use VectorRetriever

*Semantic Search*: Finding nodes based on content meaning, not just keywords.

*Unstructured Data*: Your graph contains text-rich nodes like products, reviews, or descriptions.

*Precomputed Embeddings*: Nodes have embeddings stored as properties.

== Setting Up VectorRetriever

Follow these steps to set up and use the VectorRetriever.

=== Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Install necessary Python packages:

[source, bash]
pip install neo4j-graphrag neo4j openai

=== Step 2: Connect to Your Neo4j Database

Establish a connection using the Neo4j Python driver:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/2-neo4j-graphrag/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=setup]
----

=== Step 3: Set Up the Embedding Function

Define a function to generate query embeddings using OpenAI's model:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/2-neo4j-graphrag/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=embedder]
----

=== Step 4: Initialize the VectorRetriever

Create an instance of VectorRetriever:

[source, python]
include::{repository-raw}/main/2-neo4j-graphrag/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=retriever]
----

== Example in Action

Assume you have a recommendations database with movies, each having an embedding property.

=== Running the Retriever

Given a query, VectorRetriever finds semantically similar movies:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/2-neo4j-graphrag/solutions/vector_retriever.py[tag=graphrag]
----

=== Expected Output
----
There are several movies about the famous Titanic ship. Some of them include:

1. "Titanic" (1997) - This film tells the story of a seventeen-year-old aristocrat who falls in love with a kind, but poor artist aboard the luxurious, ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic.

2. "Titanic" (1953) - This version focuses on an unhappy married couple dealing with their problems on board the ill-fated ship.

3. "A Night to Remember" (1958) - This movie provides an account of the ill-fated maiden voyage of RMS Titanic in 1912.
----

== Tips for Effective Use

*Consistent Embeddings*: Use the same model for query and node embeddings.
Vector Indexing: Create a vector index in Neo4j on the embedding property to speed up searches.
*Adjust top_k*: Set top_k based on the number of desired results.
