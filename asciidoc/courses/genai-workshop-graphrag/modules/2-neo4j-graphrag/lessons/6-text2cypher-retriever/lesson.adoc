== Understanding Text2CypherRetriever

The `Text2CypherRetriever` simplifies the retrieval process by translating natural language queries into Cypher queries using a large language model (LLM). This approach eliminates the need for manual Cypher query writing and complex embedding setups, making data retrieval more intuitive and accessible.

=== What is Text2Cypher?

Text2Cypher converts natural language into Cypher queries. The `Text2CypherRetriever` leverages this by generating precise Cypher queries based on user input, executing them against the Neo4j database, and using the results to inform the language model's responses. This method allows users to interact with the database using plain language, enhancing ease of use and flexibility.

== When to Use Text2CypherRetriever

* **Simplicity**: When you want to avoid manually writing Cypher queries.
* **Natural Interaction**: When users prefer interacting in natural language.
* **Accessibility**: When aiming to make data retrieval accessible to developers with varying levels of Neo4j expertise.

== Setting Up Text2CypherRetriever

Follow these steps to set up and use the `Text2CypherRetriever`.

=== Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Install the necessary Python packages:

[source, bash]
----
pip install neo4j-genai neo4j openai
----

=== Step 2: Connect to Your Neo4j Database

Establish a connection using the Neo4j Python driver:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/2-neo4j-graphrag/solutions/text2cypher_retriever.py[tag=setup]
----

=== Step 3: Set Up the Embedding Function

Define a function to generate query embeddings using OpenAI's model:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/2-neo4j-graphrag/solutions/text2cypher_retriever.py[tag=embedder]
----

=== Step 4: Initialize the Text2CypherRetriever

Create an instance of `Text2CypherRetriever`:

[source, python]
----
include::{repository-raw}/main/2-neo4j-graphrag/solutions/text2cypher_retriever.py[tag=retriever]
----
* `driver`: Neo4j database driver.
* `llm`: Large language model for query generation.
* `neo4j_schema`: (Optional) Schema definition for better query accuracy.
* `examples`: (Optional) Example queries to guide the LLM.

== Example in Action

Assume you have a recommendations database with movies and actors.

=== Running the Retriever

Use the `Text2CypherRetriever` to find movies starring Hugo Weaving and integrate it into a GraphRAG pipeline:

[source, python]
----
from neo4j_graphrag.generation import GraphRAG

llm = OpenAILLM(model_name="gpt-4o", model_params={"temperature": 0})
rag = GraphRAG(retriever=retriever, llm=llm)

query_text = "Which movies did Hugo Weaving star in?"
response = rag.search(query_text=query_text)
print(response.answer)
----
=== Expected Output

----
Hugo Weaving starred in the following movies:
- The Dressmaker
- V for Vendetta
- The Matrix
- The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert
- Proof
----

== Tips for Effective Use

* **Consistent Embeddings**: Use the same model for query and node embeddings.
* **Schema Definition**: Provide a clear Neo4j schema to improve query accuracy.
* **Example Queries**: Supply example queries to guide the LLM in generating accurate Cypher queries.
* **Handle Errors**: Be prepared to handle `Text2CypherRetrievalError` if the generated query is incorrect.
